					<h2>Idea</h2>
					<p>Born and raised in Nepal, the one problem that I always saw my parents face was calling abroad. We have family all over the world, so every call to loved ones became a game of memorization. Unless you have never called a foreign country before, you should know that to call abroad you first have to dial an exit code for the country you are in and then dial the country code to enter the country you are trying to call to. I thought why not make this a little bit easier. </p>

					<h2>Design</h2>
					<img id="country_codes_wire_frames" src="images/CountryCodesWireFrames.jpg">
					<p>For something so simple, I wanted the app to only be one page. The user should be able to get in, get the data, and call immediately. For many of the other apps I saw on the market, the user themselves had to figure out what the correct combinations of codes were. This was too much work. 

					<br><br>

					I went through a couple of initial designs. In the first design above, it was almost a questionnaire like method of retrieving the info from user. It did not have the ease of use to it that I wanted. The design then evolved into search queries like Google as shown in the second design. I loved the addition of call and copy buttons at the bottom. I ended up disliking it due to the clutter of information on the screen. The two search queries in one page made it too daunting. I then finally decided upon the third design. It fixed all the previous design issues while keeping the positives. It has a simple sliding middle panel to let user go through the steps. A constant dial and copy buttons on the bottom makes it easy to do either call to action an easy task. </p>

					<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>The first roadblock I faced was figuring out how to actually get the raw data. I luckily found an awesome open source project that put together all countries and their various info including country codes into a csv file. Although, it did not have the exit codes so I manually entered all 300 or so for each country/island. It was a fun three days.

					<br><br>

					I also wanted a sleek search bar that had the ability to give suggestions as the user types the countries. I opted for another open source project called Floating Search View. It has everything a search bar needs.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I gained valuable experience in making something from the ground up. Although, I want to work backend in the future I learned that I do enjoy the design process as well. I never knew myself as an artistic person so therefore I am pleasantly surprised at my new liking.
					
					<br><br>

					On the development side, I noticed that my code was getting a bit messy. Things were jumbled up everywhere. I have heard of MVP/MVC patterns through posts on Reddit. I would love to try that out in my next project.
